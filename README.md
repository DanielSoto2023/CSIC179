# CSIC179 Project
 Project for my CSIC170 Class.


The program creates a 2d array with the dimensions the user specifices. After filling the array with random 0's and 1's it will then find the longest streak of 1's both vertically and horizontally. It also transposes the array using numpy to find the longest vertical streak of 1's.
